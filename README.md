Lets gamify your training!

## Viewing the xAPI Package via GitHub Pages

The extracted xAPI package should be committed under the [`public/`](public/) directory. GitHub Pages is configured to serve this directory directly from the `main` branch.

After pushing changes to `main`:

1. Wait for the `Deploy static content to Pages` workflow to complete.
2. Visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/xapi-gamify/` in a browser to view the training package.

The content in `public/` is served statically, so no external Rise API calls are required.
